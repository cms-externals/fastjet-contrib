New in Version 1.1 is the following constructor for creating a VariableRPlugin.
This is available from VariableRPlugin.hh header:

   VariableRPlugin(double rho, double min_r, double max_r,
                   VRClustType clust_type, bool precluster);
   
   rho = mass parameter of VR algorithm, where the effective radius is R~rho/pT.
   min_r = minimum allowed jet radius
   max_r = maximum allowed jet radius
   clust_type = AKTLIKE, CALIKE, KTLIKE, for determining the cluster ordering
   precluster = true to build small kT jets of size min_r before applying VR.

For backwards compatibility with Version 1.0, we define the AKTVR and CAVR
classes with fewer options (plus a KTVR for consistency).  These are available
in the VariableR.hh header.

   AKTVR(double rho, double max_r):  variable-R anti-kT algorithm
   CAVR(double rho, double max_r):   variable-R Cambridge-Aachen algorithm
   KTVR(double rho, double max_r):   variable-R kT algorithm

Recommended usage is AKTLIKE.

Note:  Version 1.1 is based on a new clustering code written by David Krohn,
which should be faster than the previous version.  Version 1.0 had a
CoreJetAlgorithm, which allowed the definition of generic pairwise recombination
scheme.  This functionality is now available in the FastJet NNH class, so
CoreJetAlgorithm is no longer needed.
