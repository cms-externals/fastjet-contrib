1.1.1 (2014-06-02): Added VariableRPlugin.cc/.hh to conform to recommended
                    FastJet naming structure.  Old VariableR.hh header preserved
                    for backwards compatibility.
1.1.0 (2014-04-18): New version incorporates optimized code from David Krohn,
                    which should be faster than the old version.  The AKTVR and
                    CAVR interfaces are the same as v1.0 (with identical
                    results). An additional VariableRPlugin interface is
                    available, which is now recommended.  This new interface
                    offers the possibility of setting a min_r > 0 as well as
                    using kT preclustering for speed gains.
                    
1.0.1 (2013-02-23): Fixed memory management and potential dependency issue
                    (thanks FJ authors)
1.0.0 (2013-02-22): New release using FastJet contrib framework.  All of the
                    code has been merged into the VariableR.hh and VariableR.cc
                    files (whereas previously there were separate files for AKT,
                    CA, and the CoreJetAlgorithm classes).  The example program
                    runs both AKTVR and CAVR.
