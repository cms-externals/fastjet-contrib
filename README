This is the README file for the fastjet-contrib project

     http://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/

which provides a library of 3rd-party add-ons to FastJet (http://fastjet.fr/) 

======================================================================
Instructions for generic users
------------------------------

You should have downloaded a tarball for the contrib. Unpack it, enter
the resulting directory and run

  ./configure [--fastjet-config=FILE] [--prefix=...] [...]
  make
  make check   # optional
  make install

Once you have installed, a contrib named XYZ will typically be
accessible through a line

#include "fastjet/contrib/XYZ.hh"

with the corresponding library available through -lXYZ .

Queries about the fastjet-contrib project as a whole should be sent to
<fastjet@projects.hepforge.org> 

Queries about individual contribs should be sent to the people
mentioned in the contrib/AUTHORS file

======================================================================
For users who want the latest version (and for developers)
----------------------------------------------------------

Get an svn checkout of the top-level directory
  
    svn co http://fastjet.hepforge.org/svn/contrib/trunk fjcontrib

which contains the scripts and a current list of contribs and their
versions. Within the fjcontrib directory, get the contribs themselves
by running

  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh

usually, the contribs are tagged (released) versions and there is
one svn checkout for each contrib. Then proceed with configure, make, etc.

To get updates at a later stage:

  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh                       # all contribs
  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh  ContribName          # just a specific contrib
  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh  ContribName version  # specific version of a contrib

The command always updates the top level directory. If "version" is
"trunk", then you get the development area for the Contrib -- do this
only if you're a developer of that contrib.

For further information on development, see the file DEVEL-GUIDELINES.
