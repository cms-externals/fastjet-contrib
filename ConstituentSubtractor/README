ConstituentSubtractor is part of the fastjet-contrib project.

The ConstituentSubtractor class corrects jets for background contamination at particle-level as described in

   Particle-level pileup subtraction for jets and jet shapes

   arXiv:1403.3108

The code example.cc illustrates how to use the class.
It can be built using

    make example

example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
/data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example.ref
