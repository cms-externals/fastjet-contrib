LundPlane FastJet contrib
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LundPlane FastJet contrib provides tools necessary to construct
the Lund Plane of a jet.

It is based on arXiv:1807.04758 by Frederic Dreyer, Gavin Salam, and
Gregory Soyez.

It provides the following C++ classes:

- LundDeclustering
  Contains the declustering variables associated with a node on
  the Lund plane.

- LundGenerator
  A tool to generate a vector of LundDeclustering for a given jet
  corresponding to its primary Lund plane.

- LundWithSecondary
  A tool to generate primary, and secondary, lund planes of a jet
  according to the definition given as input.

- SecondaryLund, SecondaryLund_{mMDT|dotmMDT|Mass}
  Provides a definition for the leading emission.

There are two C++ examples which can be compiled with

> make example example_secondary

The example program can be run using 
> ./example < ../data/single-event.dat

and will output the primary lund plane declusterings as well as
generating a jets.json file, which can be read by a python script:

> python3 ./example.py

Some python classes to assist with reading and processing the json file
are provided in the read_lund_json.py module.

The example_secondary program outputs both the primary and secondary
Lund plane declusterings to screen, and can be run with:

> ./example_secondary < ../data/single-event.dat
